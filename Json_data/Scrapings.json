        "If you are any sort of baseball fan, you will love this in depth documentary. Being a Houston native I already thought Nolan Ryan was amazing, but this just opened my eyes so much more. I couldn't recommend this more. I'm so glad I had the chance to see it!", 
        "This was the best documentary I have ever seen!\nI already was a huge Nolan Ryan as a baseball player fan but I am a bigger fan of him as a regular human and family man now.  This was an incredibly made documentary with so many baseball legends.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.", 
        "Very well done!  Great clips from the past!", 
        "It was a well made documentary on the outstanding career of Nolan Ryan! You dont have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this film.", 
        "If you are a baseball fan, this is a great story about one of the greatest pitchers off all time.  It covers his flaws, his dominance, and his family.  It's great story.", 
        "Excellent movie of family values, friends and baseball life.", 
        "Loved this movie!  Huge fan and this movie was spot on!", 
        "An absolute MUST-WATCH movie for everyone in the family. Baseball fans. Fans of Americana. Just a great great movie.",

        "The initial character setup slightly off but after that this was completely great.", 
        "The best movie I have seen in the last 10+ years.  Original story and screenplay, jaw dropping action sequences, great character development, edge of your seat climactic moments, great themes, and times of sadness, happiness, laughter, and conflict.   Overall a memorable and impactful movie that is best seen in the theaters where you can feel the sound vibrations coming from the planes as they take off on there missions and also pull of some amazing feats in the sky thereby making you feel like you are there in a sense.", 
        "EPIC!  just as good as the first one!", 
        "Holy crap!!!! Just go see it. Still overwhelmed.", 
        "Loved the jets. Amazing cinematography. Didn’t understand the love interest story line. Guessing it came from a short storyline about an Admirals daughter in the first movie but don’t think they explained it well and seemed fake. That’s the reason why 4 1/2 stars instead of 5.", 
        "Better than the first, and with a well matured Maverick.", 
        "It was fantastic. Any fan of the original, or of flying will love it. Tom Cruise is great (and I'm not a big fan), great cast and non-stop action. Highly recommended!", 
        "Hard to beat the first,  but they did", 
        "Great and perfect movie for anyone!", 
        "Excellent justice to the original.  Yes, tears will flow in parts, but not really what you expect.  The action was second to none.  Almost feel like you're in the cockpit!!!"

        "Visually epic. Decent story. B+ on the Marvel scale of story-telling.", 
        "Another great Marvel movie, liked the interaction with the characters of the Marvel universe :)", 
        "The movie delivered as promised.  It risked being overlong, but key aspects of the Marvel universe were finally displayed and in grand style.  There is promise for an ongoing storyline.  Cumberbatch remains perfectly cast.  A wee bit tired of the Phoenix/Wanda over-powered sags.  Looking forward to seeing demons thwarted!", 
        "The experience was very exciting with the moving sits", 
        "This film was INCREDIBLE!!! My wife and I are fans of the MCU. We LOVED the first one and didn't think the second one would be better. How wrong we were. It had lots of action and plenty of horror. We loved the horror aspect of the movie. Sam Raimi did an unbelievable job. We are also fans of Raimi's. If you haven't seen it yet, take our advice and see it in the theater. You won't be disappointed. Also, the ending will put you on the edge of your seat. We just seen this and can't wait for the next one. Congrats to Sam Raimi, Marvel, and Kevin Feige on a great piece of work!. Trust us when we say you will be really disappointed if you don't see it in the theater.", 
        "love the plot multiple universe's  surprised by horror the images and themes.", 
        "10/10 everything you can possibly hope it would be!", 
        "So good I saw it twice, once in IMAX 3D and once in Digital 3D.  My favorite Marvel movie yet.  You may want to watch Dr, Strange and Wanda Vision beforehand if you've never seen them or rewatch them if it's been a while since you saw them to refresh your memory.  It's a great mix of action, horror, and comedy with stunning visuals.", 
        "After paying a premium price to watch Dr Strange at the Jersey Gardens AMC Dolby Theater, I was disappointed by how badly the sound system was maintained. The front speaker volume was so loud as be distorted and out of balance with the acoustics of the theater. My ears are still ringing!  This was not realistic sound. It was badly set up sound. Voices were strained and unnatural.  Too bad, maybe AMC should send one of their techs to my place to experience how good a well-balanced Dolby Atmos set up can sound. Worse, the sound cut out entirely for five minutes during a key segment of the movie. Probably from having blown a circuit breaker!  Disappointed."

        "Alex Garland is the most tedious filmmaker in a24's roster after maybe Ari Aster. A smug, empty, navel-gazing exercise in allyship that we used to buy wholesale from dudes like Alex Garland before we learned better (e.g. if a dude is this desperate to let you know that he's \"one of the good ones\" -- get as far away as you can). Bad pacing and choppy editing only serve to expose how empty-headed and one-note the script is. His only critique is \"men bad\" which, like, yeah and? There's no elaboration or insight, just tepid satire of the lowest order. On top of all that, Garland doesn't seem to know if he's making a body horror movie, a folk horror movie or a cosmic horror movie and as a result the thing just gets all mangled up. It's got that standard A24 sheen (which: yuck), but don't let that fool you: this movie is a mess and you'll spend 100 minutes wishing you were doing just about anything else.", 
        "Some of the visuals need a little touch up and when they came up took me out of the story for a moment but overall it was really good. Creepy, unexpected, and reminded me of some of my weirdest nightmares. I wish more time was spent on explaining our characters motivations but I see the creators reasoning for not", 
        "Definitely a unique film. Expected to be really shocked and confused due to the other reviews. For the horror genre it was actually quite normal. Cinematography was solid. Really enjoyed what it tried to do. The ending could’ve driven the point home more or given the audience more but it’s also great because it’s open to interpretation. Worth a watch", 
        "Very confusing but good", 
        "The story made no sense whatsoever!", 
        "I was not clear on the ending , I thought that everything was just in her imagination.", 
        "Did not care for this at all.  Disappointed.   It wasn't as scary as it was more psychologically weird than anything.", 
        "Definitely not a film that's for everybody. The film is heavily metaphorical and if you can bear with on that then you may be able to enjoy or at the very least get through. for me this movie might require a few watches before I can say or even interpret what it means. it's not exactly clear but it is a horror-ish nightmare of a scenario and I was able to enjoy it on that.",

        "An amazing film, not what I expected. Very fast paced playing with some serious personal issues using the idea of multiple or parallel realities which are getting some serious consideration in the Quantum world. I can't say I followed it completely and I want to see it again. It seemed to be a science fiction ,psychological introspection ,time travel, love story, mother/daughter ,kung fu psychedelic trip with sex toys! A masterpiece of film editing. It left an impression for sure .Kind of a WTF feeling.........", 
        "maybe the perfect movie",

        "A little bit all over the place with the plot (I suppose that fits the title), which left some segments leaving you feeling a bit lost as to what is even going on, but I thought overall it balanced the comedy and the emotions really well and had a very strong ending that tied most of what was happening together while also doing a really good job of exploring existential and philosophical questions in life.", 
        "This movie is stupid good! Third time watching it in theaters and I'm still noticing new things and experiencing the emotions/laughs like the first time I saw it. This movie has a little bit of everything. It is a must watch!", 
        "best movie I've ever seen in my life. it's like they made it for me. I now feel not so alone on this earth knowing it's others like me",

        "Took a little while to get rolling, but it's one of those movies that has so much in it I'll probably have to see it again (and again?). I get the feeling that my graduate-level QM course is going to make my head spin similarly.\nLove the cast!",

Wahlberg gave his typical good performance while Mel Gibson, in a supporting role, was a standout.  \n\nWhether one philosophically or religiously agrees with the main character at the end of the film or not(btw--I'm not Catholic), the film asks each viewer to make the same analysis of the meaning of suffering, trials and when bad things happen in our own lives, whether our decisions were partly to blame (or, as several of the characters were by their own choices, wholly  to blame) or whether we are victims of circumstance be it parents, auto accidents, etc.  \n\nThough it's not a heart-pounding, thrill ride, Father Stu is a meaningful and inspiring 2-hour watch.",

I really can't wait for the next chapter in this new Batman trilogy!",

        "It was verrrrry well done and both leading actors killed it - no pun intended 😱😂", 
        "Loved this movie from start to finish. It is no Hollywood bang bang type of movie but what a great story of love, brotherhood and friendship as well as redemption. I thought this movie was amazing. Loved the noir feel of it peppered with fantastic subtle comedy and even surprise appearances by Tiffany Haddish and Henry Winkler. The only flaw was it was too short. I couldve watched this story unfold all day long. Great performances by the two leading characters. Appreciated the references to race relations and acceptance. This movie goes to show you - you never know what is going on with your neighbor, the person in line at the store next to you or even your own family members. Treat people with kindness as you do not know their circumstances. Great directing debut for Jerrod Carmichael!"

        "This French movie is about abortion when this procedure was illegal in the 1960s France, and the law was strictly enforced and everyone was afraid to break it, no doctor would risk jail if a woman ventured to request an abortion. So, when this young woman became accidentally pregnant, she was devastated because it meant to throw away her ambition to pursue a professional career and her future. When she sought an abortion, no one would dare to help her, no friends or her physicians wanted to hear about it. The young woman makes risky attempts to end her pregnancy and her life became a nightmare. This movie arrives in the United States when American women are on the verge of losing their right to choose an abortion thanks to an impending decision by judges in the Supreme Court bent on ending this right that has existed for almost fifty years.", 
        "Unflinching and intense. Well acted.", 
        "Excellent story, excellent acting.  This is a difficult story that needs to be told and heard by the masses.", 
        "A graphic, courageous, heart-wrenching French film about a young woman who seeks an abortion when it was still illegal.", 
        "Very topical movie.  The abortion was horrible and in your face. I hope we focus more on providing support for women, no matter what their choice.", 
        "The best movie I've seen all year. Also the most important movie you'll see this year.", 
        "As unflinchingly raw, real & relevant a film the world has ever needed right now. Cinematically magnificent  in every facet. It must not be missed. It cannot be forgotten."

        "LOVED REMEMBERING HEAVEN!!! Saw it Saturday night and was impressed - but the volume was ear-splitting. Had to sit there with my fingers in my ears to be able to muffle the volume. Only 5 of us in the audience. \nSaw the movie again this morning with two family members. Upon entering, I asked the young man at the ticket scanner if the volume could please be turned down. Apparently he did have it turned down because it was much more bearable - yet was still quite loud. Important that we do NOT lose any of our hearing because of being subjected to ear-splitting volume! THANK YOU!!! Have just spread the word to my friends - and hope to rearrange my schedule to see it one more time."

Disjointed, poor character development, and no real plot! We love Colin Firth and have NO idea why he would associate with this movie!! Such a disappointment! Every character in this movie is creepy!",

        "no scares. just gross and creepy and unless you buy into the weird premise, barely works at all. One \"monster\" looks like a bad puppet. Other than a few characters, the acting is pretty mediocre and and if the characters had half a brain they'd see what's going on. No one seems to have a clue until it's too late. All that and you get to read subtitles for 90 minutes. Pass.", 
        "Weird and semi-infuriating at parts. Characters act with an unbelievable ignorance and lack of situational awareness. Super weird. Close to “so bad it’s good” status but not quite there.", 
        "This is the most amazing, original horror film I have ever seen.  It is not boring even though it is Finnish.  The monster in it is terrifying.  How it changes the girl who hatches it is very frightening.  The mother is just as terrifying.  It is an interesting study how parents project their own failed ambitions onto their children.   First rate acting especially from the girl, mother and adulterous lover.  This director is going to be around.",
